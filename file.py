Create a program that asks a user to input 5 unique words.
Construct a list of the 5 input values, in the order that the user gave them.
Have the program display a list where each index corresponds to the length of the word given by the user at the corresponding index.
You may assume accurate input values. NO LOOPS

Create a program that asks a user to input 3 numeric values
Construct a list of the 3 input values, in the order that the user gave them.
Have the program display a list with each of the values as integers that have been doubled 
You may assume accurate input values.
